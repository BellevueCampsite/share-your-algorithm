# Share Your Algorithm

The main purpose of this repository is for students to share their solutions to the **[Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) Front End Development Certification** algorithm challenges. Because most algorithm challenges will have several possible solutions, it can be useful for the student to compare his/her solution to other student's solutions.

The secondary purpose of this repository is for students to gain experience working collaboratively with GitHub.

## How to Use

First independently complete the challenge. Once you are satisfied with your solution, compare your solution to existing solutions for that particular challenge. If your solution is different, add your solution to the solutions page, and submit a pull request.

**Do not** review the solutions before you have independently complete your own solution as it will drastically reduce your learning experience.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Directory Structure

The Front End Development Certification map currently includes three stages of algorithm challenges, **Basic Algorithm Scripting**, **Intermediate Algorithm Scripting**, and **Advanced Algorithm Scripting**, and each stage include multiple challenges.

The repository directory follows the same structure, one folder per stage and one single Markdown file per challenge. The name of each folder and file should match the stage and challenge names exactly.

### File Layout

Coming soon.
